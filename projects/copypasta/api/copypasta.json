Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me nuggets near and far. Enjoy my tasty nuggly treats, in comfy big boy booster seats. McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's, But of my nuggets none remains. She tries to make me take a nappy, But sleeping doesn't make me happy. Nuggies are the only food, That puts me in the napping mood. I'll scream and shout and make a fuss, I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Nuggets are my heart's desire, Fueled by raging, hungry fire. Mummy sobs and wails and cries, But tears aren't nugs, tendies or fries. My good-boy points were fairly earned, To buy the nuggets that I've yearned. But there's no nuggets on my plate! Did mummy think that I'd just ate? NUGGETS NUGGETS GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW! I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise. For she who is un-pooped on is she who shan't be smug: Never forget my chicken nugs.",
