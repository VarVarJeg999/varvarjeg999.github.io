Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me nuggets near and far. Enjoy my tasty nuggly treats, in comfy big boy booster seats. McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane's, But of my nuggets none remains. She tries to make me take a nappy, But sleeping doesn't make me happy. Nuggies are the only food, That puts me in the napping mood. I'll scream and shout and make a fuss, I'll scratch, I'll bite, I'll even cuss! Nuggets are my heart's desire, Fueled by raging, hungry fire. Mummy sobs and wails and cries, But tears aren't nugs, tendies or fries. My good-boy points were fairly earned, To buy the nuggets that I've yearned. But there's no nuggets on my plate! Did mummy think that I'd just ate? NUGGETS NUGGETS GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW! I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul-smell bowel-dwelling diaper surprise. For she who is un-pooped on is she who shan't be smug: Never forget my chicken nugs.",

I feel like I should just leave because clearly nobody wants to be around me and everyone would be happier if i left anyways so i’ll just go and i hope all of you find happiness in life and i’m sorry for all the troubles i’ve ever put any of you through. i give up. goodbye.",

There has been no particular reason for this, perhaps burnout, perhaps I have beaten the game with a 1650 character. Again, there is no big reason for my absence. Just think about the good times that I did 78% damage in that Kayangel run, or the time I used my personal balthor to shield everyone. Again, no reason for the departure. I may return one day however, maybe on a newer account to revisit the game and play as a mokoko again. who knows, but for now, goodbye Heroes of Arkesia!",
