# Chapter 1: The Birth of the Prison

In the year 2024, the world was a vastly different place. The internet was still reeling from the collapse of the social media giants, and the gaming community was in chaos. The R/banvideogames soldiers, a ragtag group of gamers and internet personalities, had declared war on the Bullshittery Army, a coalition of online trolls and haters.

The war had been raging for months, with both sides trading blows and insults online. But on November 4th, 2024, the Bullshittery Army made a decisive move. They completed the construction of the Prison of Dank Memeria, a maximum-security facility designed to hold the R/banvideogames soldiers.

The prison was a behemoth of a structure, with 4 cells when it was first built. But in December 2024, the Bullshittery Army added 4 more cells, expanding the prison's capacity to hold more inmates.

On December 18th, 2024, the first prisoners arrived, including two spouses who were among the initial group of inmates. The prison staff was still getting used to their new surroundings, and the prisoners were just trying to make the best of a bad situation.

And so, the Prison of Dank Memeria was born, a place where the boundaries between reality and internet culture would be blurred, and the lines between prisoner and prison guard would be constantly tested.

# Chapter 2: Life Inside the Prison

As the days turned into weeks, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a strange and familiar place. The prisoners, including Franceball and Germanyball, the infamous married couple, settled into a routine of boredom and boredom-fueled creativity.

The prison staff, didn't Exist
But despite the non-existence of the prison staff, the prison was fine without prison staff (memer here: sidenote Idfk how it is fine without prison staff)

The prison itself became a character in the story, a place where the boundaries between reality and internet culture were constantly blurred. The prisoners found ways to subvert the prison's systems, turning the tables on their captors and creating a sense of community and camaraderie.

As the months passed, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a place of legend, a place where the brave and the ridiculous came to be tested. And France and Germanyball, those infamous spouses, were at the center of it all.

But what about the other prisoners? What about the rest of the R/banvideogames soldiers? Did they know what was happening, or were they just waiting for news? And what about the prison staff? Did they have a plan, or were they just winging it?

These are the questions that Chapter 3 will answer, but for now, let's just say that life inside the Prison of Dank Memeria was a wild and wacky ride, full of memes, madness, and occasional moments of clarity.
