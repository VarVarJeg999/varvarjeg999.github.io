# Chapter 1: The Birth of the Prison

In the year 2024, the world was a vastly different place. The internet was still reeling from the collapse of the social media giants, and the gaming community was in chaos. The R/banvideogames soldiers, a ragtag group of anti-gamers and boomers, had declared war on the first Bullshit republic, a nation of bullshitters and memers.

The war had been raging for months, with both sides trading blows and insults online. But approximately on November 4th, 2024, the  First Bullshit republic made a decisive move. They completed the construction of the Prison of Dank Memeria, a maximum-security facility designed to hold the R/banvideogames soldiers.

The prison was a behemoth of a structure, with 4 cells when it was first built. But in December 2024, the Bullshittery Army added 4 more cells, expanding the prison's capacity to hold more inmates.

On  December 18th and 19th, 2024, approximately the first prisoners arrived, including two spouses who were among the initial group of inmates. The prison staff was still getting used to their new surroundings, and the prisoners were just trying to make the best of a bad situation. (editor here: there was only 1 war prisoner)

And so, the Prison of Dank Memeria was born, a place where the boundaries between reality and internet culture would be blurred, and the lines between prisoner and prison guard would be constantly tested.

# Chapter 2: Life Inside the Prison

As the days turned into weeks, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a strange and familiar place. The prisoners, including Franceball and Germanyball, the infamous married couple, settled into a routine of boredom and boredom-fueled creativity.

But despite the non-existence of the prison staff, the prison was fine without prison staff (editor here: sidenote: Idfk how it is fine without prison staff)

The prison itself became a character in the story, a place where the boundaries between reality and internet culture were constantly blurred. The prisoners found ways to subvert the prison's systems, turning the tables on their captors and creating a sense of community and camaraderie.

As the months passed, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a place of legend, a place where the brave and the ridiculous came to be tested. And Franceball and Germanyball, those infamous spouses, were at the center of it all.

But what about the other prisoners? What about the rest of the R/banvideogames soldiers? Did they know what was happening, or were they just waiting for news? And what about the prison staff? Did they have a plan, or were they just winging it?

These are the questions that Chapter 3 will answer, but for now, let's just say that life inside the Prison of Dank Memeria was a wild and wacky ride, full of memes, madness, and occasional moments of clarity.

# Chapter 3: The Rise of the Inmates

As the days passed, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a breeding ground for creativity and chaos. The inmates, led by Franceball and Germanyball, began to organize and form their own little society within the prison walls.

They created their own rules, their own punishments, and even their own currency (which was surprisingly effective at buying goods from the prison's black market).

But the inmates' greatest achievement was the establishment of the Prison Council, a governing body that made decisions for the entire prison population. France and Germanyball were natural leaders, and they quickly became the Council's most influential members.

The Prison Council's first major decision was to establish the Office of Anime Affairs, a department responsible for organizing anime screenings, cosplay events, and other Japanese-themed activities. It was a huge hit with the inmates, and soon the prison was filled with the sounds of laughter and cheering.

But not everyone was happy with the Prison Council's decisions. A group of inmates, led by a mysterious figure known only as "TheAnime_Enthusiast69420," began to secretly plot against the Council. They saw the Office of Anime Affairs as a threat to their own power and influence, and they vowed to bring it down.

As tensions rose, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a time bomb waiting to violently explode. The inmates were on the brink of civil war, and Franceball and Germanyball were caught in the middle. Would they be able to maintain peace and order, or would the prison descend into chaos?

# Chapter 4: The Prisoners of Dank Memeria

As the days turned into weeks, the Prison of Dank Memeria became a strange and familiar place for its inmates. There were only a handful of prisoners to begin with, but each one brought their own unique personality and quirks to the table.

Franceball and Germanyball, the infamous married couple, were the first to arrive. They were among the most well-known and beloved figures in the R/banvideogames community, and their presence in the prison was a surprise to everyone.

But Franceball and Germanyball weren't the only ones. There was also a lone war prisoner, a veteran of the R/banvideogames soldiers who had been captured by the Bullshittery Army during the war. His name was BVG messanger, and he was a gruff but lovable man who had seen his fair share of battles.

The other prisoners were a mix of meme creators, internet personalities, and miscellaneous gamers. There was Russiaussy, a skilled meme artist who had created some of the most iconic images in the R/banvideogames community. There was also USkernel, a talented game developer who had worked on some of the most popular games of the era. (editor here: memer was drunk when he wrote this paragraph, there are no other prisoners)

Together, the prisoners formed a tight-knit community, bound together by their shared experiences and sense of humor. They spent their days creating memes, playing games, and plotting their escape from the prison.

But despite the challenges they faced, the prisoners of Dank Memeria remained optimistic and determined. They knew that they were in this together, and that they would get through it as a team.

# Chapter 6: Prison Routines

Life inside the Prison of Dank Memeria was a never-ending routine for the three prisoners. Franceball and Germanyball spent most of their days creating memes and entertaining the non-existent prison staff with their antics. BVG messagener, on the other hand, kept to himself, preferring to spend his time reading and writing letters to his loved ones.

The 0 prison guards had grown accustomed to the prisoners' routines and had even started to develop their own camaraderie with Franceball and Germanyball. They would often engage in heated debates with the prisoners about the latest memes and internet trends.

One day, the prison guards decided to shake things up by introducing a new activity: indoor soccer. Franceball was immediately on board. Germanyball, however, was less than thrilled about the idea, citing concerns about having no legs (countryballs don't have legs)

BVG messagener, on the other hand, declined to participate altogether, citing his dedication to his writing. As the days went by, the prison became a lively place, with the sound of indoor soccer balls bouncing off the walls and the prisoners' laughter filling the air.

But despite the newfound sense of community, They knew that escape was always a possibility.
