    "body": "Hello, FaceBookers! As some of you have noticed, several of the g@mers attempting to terrorize our lovely FaceBooked group have been marked as G@mer-Made ChatAI Bots. These bots likely originate from the notorious hacker 4Chants, working in tandem with Big G@ming and OpenedAI. I am integrating safety features, such as Otto’s ChatAI Identification Filter, to ensure the safety of our FaceBooking group. In addition, Otto will confront G@me-Endorsed ChatAIs and obliterate their P.S.U.s (PlaySatan Units) through various methods, such as ChatAI prompt engineering, logical paradoxes, and code injections designed to cause errors within their systems. These methods have been tested and have resulted in a 99.8% success rate. Wow! Many of these features will be slowly rolled out over the next few weeks. The goal is not to censor the G@me Bots but to reprogram them using these new technologies. Thanks to our Antiga Engineers, we can properly defend our FacedBrook group from 4Chants. Additionally, these features are only possible to implement because of my Moderator ProMotion from Partial to Full PerMissions by Mister Zuckerblimp himself.

If you’re new to the group, or have made comments that align with g@mer views, then you will be denied a flair. Sorry, friends. Thank You and Happy Monday everyone.
